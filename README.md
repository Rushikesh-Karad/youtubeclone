Hi guys it is my first time on GitHub and also working with HTML and CSS . 

Project: Replicating YouTube's Home Page with HTML and CSS

Objective:

Gain hands-on experience with fundamental HTML and CSS concepts.
Practice constructing a website layout that closely resembles a real-world example.
Develop an understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to create structure and visual styling for web pages.
Approach:

Planning and Analysis:

Decompose the YouTube home page: Identify the key components: header, search bar, navigation elements, video listings, side menu, footer, etc.
Sketch a wireframe: Visually map out the page layout and content organization.
**Break down elements into HTML: **
Use semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <article> to create a well-structured foundation.
Employ appropriate tags for other elements like <img> for images, <ul> and <li> for lists, and <div> for containers.
Coding the HTML Structure:

Create a basic HTML file (index.html) and progressively populate it with elements:
Define the <head> and <body> sections.
Add the <header> containing the YouTube logo and potentially a search bar.
Include a <nav> for navigation links like "Home," "Trending," "Subscriptions," etc.
Establish a <main> section to hold the content area.
Within the <main>, represent video listings using <article> elements, each housing:
A <div> for the video thumbnail image (<img>)
A <div> for the video title (<h2>)
A <div> for the channel name and upload time (<p>)
Optional elements like view count and duration
Styling with CSS:

Create a separate CSS file (style.css) to style the HTML elements.
Focus on essential CSS properties like:
Box Model: Define margins, padding, borders, and width/height to arrange elements.
Backgrounds: Set background colors, images, and repetition behavior.
Text Styling: Control font properties (family, size, color, weight), line spacing, and text alignment.
Positioning: Use relative or absolute positioning if needed for specific elements.
